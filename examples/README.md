# Examples generated with Fake Data

The example files in the folder `applicants` & `plots` have been generated with fake data

**Terminology**
* Returners: Applicants that have been part of the release team before and apply again.
* Newcomers: Applicants that have not been part of the release team yet and may have applied before. 

1. [(PRIVATE) Examples of the applicant data extraction (data is not shared with the community)](#examples-markdown-extracts)
2. [(PUBLIC) Examples of the Plots (data is shared with the community)](#examples-plots--charts)

The plots are getting shared in a report with the community at the beginning of a release cycle. The [report template can be found under the `reports` folder](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/release-team-shadow-stats/tree/main/examples/reports/report-template.md).

## Examples: Markdown extracts

All the files can be found under [examples/applicants](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/release-team-shadow-stats/tree/main/examples/applicants)

For each team a `newcomers` and a `returners` file is getting generated.
